Welcome Users,

SPACE ALIEN MEMORY MATCH GAME<br/>
Match the space alien tiles and improve your memory<br/>

OVERVIEW<br/>
This is a memory match game is done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a browser-based card matching game, that consists of space-alien cards and the user matching the various 18 card pairs, to improve memory and concentration. The objective is to try and match the pairs in a ceratin amount of time.

How It Works<br/>
If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of eighteen themed space and alien graphical cards that are arranged randonmy in a grid style layout. The deck is made up of eighteen different pairs of cards, each with different fun retor style graphics on the one side (back side) and one graphic on the frnt side of the card. 

Each turn:

A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying graphic card
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same graphic card
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
There is a timer that counts down on the intitation of the game when the user starts the game
The game has a 'moves' counter that counts the amount of moves by the gamer, to try help with focus and
Notifications are displayed in the notification section.
The restart button restarts the game.

User experience (ux)<br/>
The game must offer the ability to be rendered with different sizes of the grid layout of 18 different pairs of graphic cards<br/>
The player has to be able to flip the tiles with the mouse or keyboard.<br/>
The player must only be able to flip two tiles face up at a time.<br/>
After a suitable time, matching tiles that face up must not have a visible representation in the grid.<br/>
After an appropriate time, tiles facing up and not matching must be flipped face down.<br/>
The positions, or rather the graphics, of the tiles in the grid must be randomized before each game round.<br/>
The game must count how many attempts the player has made to find matching tiles and present the number of attempts when the game round is over.<br/>
After a game round is over, the user must be allowed to restart the new game round without reloading the page.

Project Goals
a. Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.<br/>
b. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as a guide to the minimum required functionality.<br/>
c. Test a front-end web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages<br/>
d. A fully functioning, well-documented game.<br/>
e. Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform.<br/>
f. Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub.<br/>
g. Implement Front-End interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries or frameworks.<br/>
